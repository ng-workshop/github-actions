  CVE-2019-19814: "Critical -  In the Linux kernel 5.0.21, mounting a crafted f2fsfilesystem image can cause __remove_dirty_segment slab-out-of-bounds write access because an array is bounded by the number of (8) but the array index can exceed this. https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-19814"
  CVE-2021-38300: "High - arch/mips/net/bpf_jit.c in the Linux kernel before 5.4.10 can generate undesirable machine code when transforming unprivileged cBPF programs, allowing execution of arbitrary code within the kernel context. This occurs because conditional branches can exceed the 128 KB limit of the MIPS architecture.https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-38300"
  CVE-2021-3177:  "High - Python 3.x through 3.9.1 has a buffer overflow in PyCArg_repr in _ctypes/callproc.c, which may lead to remote code execution in certain Python applications that accept floating-point numbers as untrusted input, as demonstrated by a 1e300 argument to c_double.from_param. This occurs because sprintf is used unsafely.https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-3177"
  CVE-2021-20246: "High - A flaw was found in ImageMagick in MagickCore/resample.c. An attacker who submits a crafted file that is processed by ImageMagick could trigger undefined behavior in the form of math division by zero. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability. https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-20246"
  CVE-2013-7445:  "High - The Direct Rendering Manager (DRM) subsystem in the Linux kernel through 4.x mishandles requests for Graphics Execution Manager (GEM) objects, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via an application that processes graphics data, as demonstrated by JavaScript code that creates many CANVAS elements for rendering by Chrome or Firefox. https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-7445"
  CVE-2021-20309: "High - A flaw was found in ImageMagick in versions before 7.0.11 and before 6.9.12, where a division by zero in WaveImage() of MagickCore/visual-effects.c may trigger undefined behavior via a crafted image file submitted to an application using ImageMagick. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability. https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-20309"
  CVE-2021-33574: "High - The mq_notify function in the GNU C Library (aka glibc) versions 2.32 and 2.33 has a use-after-free. It may use the notification thread attributes object (passed through its struct sigevent parameter) after it has been freed by the caller, leading to a denial of service (application crash) or possibly unspecified other impact. https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-33574"
  CVE-2021-20312: "High - A flaw was found in ImageMagick in versions 7.0.11, where an integer overflow in WriteTHUMBNAILImage of coders/thumbnail.c may trigger undefined behavior via a crafted image file that is submitted by an attacker and processed by an application using ImageMagick. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability. https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-20312"
  CVE-2021-20245: "High - A flaw was found in ImageMagick in coders/webp.c. An attacker who submits a crafted file that is processed by ImageMagick could trigger undefined behavior in the form of math division by zero. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability. https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-20245"
  CVE-2021-20244: "High - A flaw was found in ImageMagick in MagickCore/visual-effects.c. An attacker who submits a crafted file that is processed by ImageMagick could trigger undefined behavior in the form math division by zero. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability. https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-20244"
  CVE-2019-25013: "High - The iconv feature in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) through 2.32, when processing invalid multi-byte input sequences in the EUC-KR encoding, may have a buffer over-read. https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-25013"
